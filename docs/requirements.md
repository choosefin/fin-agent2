# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Fin Agent platform is a hybrid financial AI system that combines Next.js frontend with Motia-orchestrated microservices for intelligent portfolio management, market analysis, and trading insights.

4. IF Python services require ML libraries THEN Azure container instances SHALL provide GPU resources and Motia SHALL manage Python dependencies efficiently

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a financial analyst, I want agents to debate and collaborate on complex financial analysis, so that I can get multi-perspective insights and comprehensive reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complex analysis is requested THEN Mastra Workflows SHALL coordinate specialist agents (quant, fundamental, technical) to debate methodologies using turn-taking conversation flows
2. WHEN agents analyze data THEN Mastra Tools SHALL interface with Motia-orchestrated Python services for heavy computational tasks like Monte Carlo simulations and ML model inference
3. WHEN generating reports THEN Mastra Agents SHALL collaborate to create comprehensive narratives that include dissenting opinions and confidence levels
4. IF analysis requires historical context THEN Mastra Memory SHALL provide agents with relevant past analysis and market memory through mem0 integration

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want Azure-integrated monitoring and observability across all containerized services, so that I can observe agent debates, system performance, and cloud resource utilization holistically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agent debates occur THEN Azure Application Insights SHALL log debate progression, consensus building, and decision rationale
2. WHEN services communicate THEN Azure Monitor SHALL track cross-service performance, latency, error rates, and container resource usage
3. WHEN mem0 operations occur THEN the system SHALL monitor memory storage, retrieval performance, and data consistency through Azure monitoring tools
4. IF AgentScope workflows fail THEN Azure SHALL capture agent state, debate context, container logs, and provide automated recovery mechanisms

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a financial researcher, I want parallel search capabilities across multiple financial data sources, so that I can quickly gather comprehensive market intelligence and research insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a research query is submitted THEN the system SHALL execute parallel searches across financial databases, news sources, SEC filings, and market data providers
