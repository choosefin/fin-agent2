# Production Deployment Action Plan

## Branch: `feat/critical-security-fixes-phase1`

### ✅ Completed Security Fixes
All critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed in this branch:
- CORS validation fixed (no more development bypass)
- Admin access secured with IP restrictions and audit logging
- Input validation comprehensive (UUID, size limits, sanitization)
- Rate limiting with proactive memory management
- Database connection pooling implemented
- Error sanitization preventing data leakage
- Azure Key Vault integration ready

---

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (Before Merge)

### 1. Security Testing Suite Implementation
Create comprehensive test coverage for all security features:

```bash
# Create test directory structure
apps/backend/__tests__/
├── security/
│   ├── auth.test.ts         # Authentication tests
│   ├── cors.test.ts         # CORS validation tests
│   ├── rate-limit.test.ts   # Rate limiting tests
│   ├── admin.test.ts        # Admin access control tests
│   └── validation.test.ts   # Input validation tests
├── integration/
│   ├── api-security.test.ts # API endpoint security
│   └── database-pool.test.ts # Connection pooling tests
└── load/
    └── stress.test.ts        # Load and stress testing
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Before deploying to production, ensure these environment variables are set:

```bash
# .env.production
NODE_ENV=production

# Security Keys (use strong, unique values)
ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY=<generate-256-bit-key>
JWT_SECRET=<generate-strong-secret>
API_SIGNING_KEY=<generate-strong-key>

# Admin Security
ADMIN_ALLOWED_IPS=<production-admin-ips>
ENFORCE_SCOPE_LIST=true

# CORS Configuration
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com

# Rate Limiting (Redis recommended for production)
REDIS_URL=redis://your-redis-instance:6379

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
DB_POOL_SIZE=20

# Azure Key Vault (for secret management)
AZURE_KEY_VAULT_NAME=your-key-vault
```

### 3. Database Migration Execution
Run the security tables migration:

```bash
# Execute migration
psql $DATABASE_URL < apps/backend/migrations/001_security_tables.sql

# Verify tables created
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\dt user_sessions, api_keys, user_permissions, audit_logs, rate_limits, encrypted_secrets, security_events"
```

### 4. Pre-Deployment Security Audit

#### A. Code Review Checklist
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or keys
- [ ] All API endpoints use authentication middleware
- [ ] Input validation on all user inputs
- [ ] Error messages sanitized (no stack traces in production)
- [ ] Admin operations require additional validation
- [ ] Rate limiting configured for all endpoints

#### B. Dependency Audit
```bash
# Check for vulnerable dependencies
npm audit
npm audit fix

# Update critical packages
npm update @supabase/supabase-js
npm update jsonwebtoken
npm update @azure/keyvault-secrets
```

#### C. Security Headers Verification
Ensure all responses include:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000`
- `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'`

### 5. Testing Requirements

#### Unit Tests to Implement
```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('Security Tests', () => {
  describe('Authentication', () => {
    test('should reject invalid JWT tokens', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    test('should enforce rate limits', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    test('should validate UUID format', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
  
  describe('Admin Access', () => {
    test('should reject non-whitelisted IPs', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    test('should enforce admin role requirement', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

#### Load Testing
```bash
# Use Artillery or K6 for load testing
artillery quick --count 100 --num 1000 https://api.yourdomain.com/test

# Verify:
# - Memory stays under limits
# - Rate limiting works correctly
# - No memory leaks
# - Connection pool handles load
```

### 6. Monitoring Setup

#### A. Application Monitoring
- Set up Azure Application Insights or equivalent
- Configure alerts for:
  - Failed authentication attempts > 10/minute
  - Rate limit violations > 100/minute
  - Memory usage > 80%
  - Database connection pool exhaustion

#### B. Security Event Monitoring
- Monitor `security_events` table for:
  - Failed admin access attempts
  - Suspicious activity patterns
  - Rate limit violations by IP

#### C. Audit Log Review
- Regular review of `audit_logs` table
- Automated alerts for critical operations
- Monthly security audit reports

### 7. Deployment Process

#### Stage 1: Staging Environment
1. Deploy to staging with production configuration
2. Run full test suite
3. Perform security scan
4. Load test with expected traffic patterns
5. Monitor for 24 hours

#### Stage 2: Production Deployment
1. Database backup
2. Deploy during low-traffic period
3. Run smoke tests immediately
4. Monitor closely for first 4 hours
5. Have rollback plan ready

#### Stage 3: Post-Deployment
1. Verify all security features active
2. Check audit logs populating correctly
3. Confirm rate limiting working
4. Test admin access with valid credentials
5. Verify CORS blocking unauthorized origins

### 8. Documentation Updates

Create/Update:
- [ ] API Security Documentation
- [ ] Admin Operation Procedures
- [ ] Incident Response Plan
- [ ] Security Configuration Guide
- [ ] Monitoring Dashboard Setup
